# Note
* the GALBA geneset is more fragmented, but also more complete
* I picked the BRAKER3 set as reference, as it is cleaner

# files for odEphMuel1 / Ephydatia muelleri
* braker.aa.xz - proteins from BRAKER3 predictions
* braker.gtf.xz - GTF style annoations from BRAKER3
* galba.aa.xz - proteins from GALBA predictions
* galba.gtf.xz - GTF style annoations from GALBA

# files hosted elsewhere
* [softmasked genome FASTA](https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/odEphMuel1/odEphMuel1.fa.masked)
